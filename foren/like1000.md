# like1000

Type: **Forensics**

This [.tar file](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/static/52084b5ad360b25f9af83933114324e0/1000.tar) got tarred a lot.

*This question is from picoCTF. PicoCTF flags are of the format: `picoCTF{answer}`.*

**Hint**: Try and script this, it'll save you a lot of time

## Solution

When you try to extract the .tar, you get another .tar. Fun.

Here's a script to automatically do the unzipping for us!

```py
import tarfile
from pathlib import Path
  

TAR_PATH = Path("1000.tar")

with tarfile.open(TAR_PATH) as tar:
    tar.extractall("out/")

for i in range(999, 0, -1):
    with tarfile.open(f"out/{i}.tar") as tar:
    tar.extractall("out/")
```
