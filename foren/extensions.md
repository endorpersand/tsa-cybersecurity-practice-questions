# extensions

Type: **Forensics**

This is a really weird text file [TXT](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/static/e7e5d188621ee705ceeb0452525412ef/flag.txt)? Can you find the flag?

*This question is from picoCTF. PicoCTF flags are of the format: `picoCTF{answer}`.*

**Hint**: How do operating systems know what kind of file it is? (It's not just the ending!

## Solution

If you open up the .txt, it appears like a .png. Rename the file extension to .png.

**Answer**: `picoCTF{now_you_know_about_extensions}`
