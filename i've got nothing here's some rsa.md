I don't have a funny quip to say here. I was gonna put like some super simple calculus but I also realize that not everyone has taken calculus yet... so...

Have fun!

```
p = 172264247183169894489153119451334259897
q = 214570086054419925362447458720950927091
e = 65537

c = 1821723370200066645588366051142376454249231561365317783558173520514583559350
```
